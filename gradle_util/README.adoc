== unify_build_dependency.py
Inspired by http://saulmm.github.io/squeezing-gradle-builds.
This script help you unify your dependencies in one place.

== unify_android_build_config.py
Inspired by http://saulmm.github.io/squeezing-gradle-builds too.
This script help you unify your android build tool in same version.

== package_exclude.py
Exclude duplicate resources in **META-INF**.
If you run into package problem, this script can automatically find the duplicate resources.

== format_settings_gradle.py
As the name suggest, format your settings.gradle file.
Please note this will not backup your original file, use it with care.

== Todo
* Perhaps **package_exclude.py** can write a gradle plugin.
But for now, I have no no idea of writing one.
