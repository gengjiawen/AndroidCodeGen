== unify_build_dependency.py
Inspired by http://saulmm.github.io/squeezing-gradle-builds.
This script help you unify your dependencies in one place

== package_exclude.py
Exclude duplicate resources in **META-INF**.
If you run into package problem, this script can automatically find the duplicate resources.


== Todo
* Perhaps package_exclude.py can write a gradle plugin,but for now, I have no
no idea of writing one.
