== gradle wrapper task
Update Grade wrapper task
[source, groovy]
task wrapper(type: Wrapper) {
    gradleVersion = '3.0'
    distributionUrl = distributionUrl.replace("bin", "all")
}

== How to accelerate your build
* Use gradle parallel feature, this can greatly speed your build by 45% from my experience.
* Use gradle daemon

=== how to enable
This is the first method
Edit your gradle.properties
[source, groovy]
org.gradle.daemon=true
org.gradle.parallel=true

Or you can just update your gradle version to 3.0.
Because gradle 3.0 enable parallel and daemon by default.
